When I asked my mom about her dental appointment, she said: 騙局, "It's a scam."  A relative took her to the dentist.  When it was time to sign consent form for treatment, she refused.
<br>
She's overdue for a root canal, a couple of extractions, and more.  I'm exhausted.  She also has high blood pressure, which takes priority.  I need to take her to the doctor again before I take her to the dentist.
<br>
I've been seeing her six to seven days a week lately.  The signs of decline are unmistakeable.  She sat on the couch in front of the TV and starting brush her teeth in her nursing home.

This is going to be short blog post.  I'm going to publish this and hope I still have free service via Gigalixir.  Then, I'm going to bed.
