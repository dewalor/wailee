My mom wanted to go to an Indonesian restaurant.  She said she was hungry and sounded rather impatient.  I wasn't sure if there were any within her walking radius.  We started in the direction of the closest one.  I started feeling my muscles contract when we were about halfway there.  Part of me knew my blood sugar was low.  I started stretching my limbs in directions.  I'm sure it looked very strange to passersby.  Eventually I sat on the sidewalk.  A woman asked me in Chinese if my blood sugar was low and if I had candy with me.  I said yes, though I was too confused and distracted by the tightness in my muscles to act.  I may lay down on the ground for a bit.  My mom stood by me in silence.

Medics came and took me and my mom into an ambulance.  They asked me if I wasn't feeling well and if I knew what had happened.  I told them I had Type 1 diabetes and probably had low blood sugar.  Something about the change of scenery cleared my mind.  After doing a quick finger prick and blood test on a glucose meter, the medics gave me an IV infusion of sugar solution.  They were quick to let me know and remind me this service was free.
<br>
At one point, a police officer boarded the ambulance and confirmed with the medics that low blood sugar was the issue.  He asked my mom how old I was.  She said I was in my forties, and then changed her answer and said: twenties.  I didn't realize she had lost track of my age.  She denied that I was diabetic.  I was relieved she was able to answer his question about the name of her nursing home.  The policeman called them to let them know what had happened and told them I would bring my mom back when I was able to.

The medics checked my blood sugar again after some time and let us go after I signed some documents about not wanting to go to the hospital.  We ended up changing our plans and going to a Thai restaurant nearby.  I'd been back in Hong Kong for about a year and had experienced four episodes of low blood sugar that affected my activities.  The most serious incident was passing out in Times Square.  A man with an American accent ask me in English if I was okay and if I lived in Hong Kong.  He had a teenage boy with him.  After I had some candy, they waited, circled back to check on me.  The boy told me I kept saying "I'm okay, I'm okay" when I first got up.  I need to be more careful about taking care of myself, particularly when I'm walking around the city, which could lead to blood sugar lows.

New Year's Day I visited SGI (Soka Gakkai International) 創価学会 at my friend Judy Juanita's suggestion. One of the first things I noticed was the SGI logo, which looks like a lotus flower and reminds me of the nuclear physics logo at the same time.  I admire SGI's activism against nuclear weapons and am curious about their history, particularly during the Second World War.  Tsunesaburō Makiguchi 牧口 (Makiguchi) 常三郎(Tsunesaburō) and Jōsei Toda 戸田 (Toda) 城聖 (Jōsei), two leaders of a precessor organization, were imprisoned, which led to the death of Makiguchi.  Their daily practice of chanting doesn't appeal to me, though I appreciated being in the presence of others who are vocal in their support of world peace.  The woman sitting in front of me was wearing a jacket with a cool message: She brings the rain.

I found the waterfront promenade in Shau Kei Wan bustling with birds and people one warm, sunny afternoon.  Bird traffic varies highly from day to day, though I continue to be surprised at how closely they let us humans approach them and how much more I am able to see here than anywhere else I've been.  I was about fifteen or twenty feet from the great egret poking at the red fabric on the roof of a boat.   Again, there was a great egret riding around on the roof of a moving boat.  A bird, possibly a night-crowned heron, flew into a tree right above my head.  A brief bird fight happened and was over in a few squawks.  Gemini-1.5-pro-002 tells me the birds may have been immature black-crowned night herons.  I saw a spotted dove well camouflaged next to the cracked and bespeckled concrete they were drinking from.  I wondered if they chose the spot knowing they would blend in.  The same question came to mind when two spotted doves met in a legume tree.
