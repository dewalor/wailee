I have to look for a job again.  Now that my mom seems to be doing better, I feel more comfortable contemplating the possibility of leaving Hong Kong.  She's gained weight.  When I take walks with her, she's no longer afraid of the dark and she doesn't think Victoria Park is shady anymore.  She's even agreed to teach me a few words of the Chaozhou/Teochew language every now and then, much to my surprise.  When I was growing up, she never answered any of my questions about the language she spoke with her family.
<br>
I'm a bit worried she'll deteriorate again if I leave.  I do think it's worth a try.  I've made a list of the things I do for her.  I hope to hire a caregiving service or contract her nursing home to provide additional help.

The birds along the Shau Kei Wan waterfront continue to fascinate me.  I wonder if this young heron with a few missing feathers was the same one that got into a fight I captured on camera earlier.

The birds seem to have a tendency to congregate sometimes.  I wonder if they like to hunt together.

I try to keep my distance so I don't disturb them.  Sometimes, they approach me.  Perhaps they're just as curious about me as I am about them.

I wonder if they knew this man was going to start fishing.  They gathered and waited long before he got out his fishing pole.  He caught several fish within minutes.  I didn't see him share his catch with the birds.  Their curiousity seems to have been rewarded simply watching the activity.
