I've been visiting my mom every other day, taking her out to dinner, giving her fruit and yogurt, and brushing her teeth.  Her speech therapist had mentioned she would need help brushing her teeth if she's in a nursing home.  A visit to the dentist confirmed this.

When I come down the hallway, she's usually smiling in her geri chair, happy to see me.  She's walking much better now, between physical therapy and going out more.  She's using the bathroom more often and less reliant on diapers.  Aside from tense moments in the bathroom every now and then, she's been in good spirits.  I've been kissing her goodnight and telling her I love her in English.

She seems to have lost interest in movies.  I've started showing her videos of animals at the suggestion of a relative.  She generally likes them, from pets to wildlife around the world.  I was surprised when she made a comment about a man washing his jeans while we were watching a National Geographic video about penguins.  The man was clearly studying the penguins, not doing his laundry.

I seldom engage my mom in political discussions.  I find Isreal's attack on Iran deeply disturbing.  A close friend from my college years married an Iranian.  He taught me to say "salaam," which means "peace," like the Hebrew "shalom."  I find it difficult to open a conversation with this greeting now, though I still try.  I would find it even more difficult to look at a world map and demarcate regions of indifference or hatred.
