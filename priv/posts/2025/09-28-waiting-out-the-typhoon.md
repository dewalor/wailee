Friends and family in the US were kind enough to reach out and ask me how my mom and I fared during Typhoon Regasa.  We were barely affected.  Instead of listening to the news on the subway, I did so at home.  I recently started a new job as a teacher.  I was able to use Google Docs to create an exercise in prepositional phrases my first day sheltering in place.  The typhoon did reveal my mom's decline has reached another level.
<br>
<br>
我: 打風呀。我呢幾日唔嚟搵你啦。
</br>
阿媽：你去邊啊？
<br>
我： 我冇地方去。我話俾你聽依家打風唔嚟搵你。
</br>
阿媽：打風同你嚟搵我有咩關係？
</br>
我： 你傻咗呀？10號風球我點嚟搵你啊？
</br>
佢先冇出聲。
<br>
<br>
Me: There’s a typhoon coming.  I won’t be visiting for a few days.
</br>
Mom: Where are you going?
</br>
Me: I’m not going anywhere.  I’m telling you there’s a typhoon coming.
</br>
Mom: What does the typhoon have to do with you coming to see me?
<br>
Me: Are you being silly/crazy?  How am I going to visit you in a Signal 10 typhoon?
<br>
<br>
Finally, silence.  
<br>
<br>
I've been struggling with what tone to use with my mom.  There's no denying I feel frustrated from time to time, especially when I feel a tinge of narcissism on her end.  I also wonder if mild shock is the best therapy.  When I visited her the next day, I brought her some food and told her again she wouldn't see me for a few days because of the typhoon.  She nodded.
<br>
<br>
Regasa came and went quickly.  In the end, she only endured two days without visits.
