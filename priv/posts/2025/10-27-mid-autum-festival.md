I don't remember the last time I celebrated Mid-Autumn Festival with my mother in Hong Kong.  We tried a couple of different mooncakes, including one with orange peel from Chiu Chow/Chao Zhou, which was exquisite.

There's a saying 月是故鄉圓, "The moon is rounder in your hometown."  Although I grew up in Hong Kong, I must say the skies are generally clearer in the US.

Mom got a lot of exercise walking to the park.   Growing up in Hong Kong, I played with lanterns lit with candles.  Lanterns have electric lights now.  I saw a sign in a park warning people not to light fires.  Burning wax in a mooncake tin was one of my fondest memories from childhood.  Times have changed.  The climate has also changed.  I couldn't believe we were still using air conditioning during the festival, and there was a Signal 3 typhoon the following week.  I think I'm going to rename this the Midsummer Festival.

 Mom wasn't interested in lanterns, so I didn't look for them.  I stumbled upon some in a store in Shau Kei Wan and bought one for next year.
