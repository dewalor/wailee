My first two visits to my mom's nursing home after my short trip back to the Bay Area were challenging.  My intention was to take her to a restaurant.  I ended up bringing her takeout, since she refused to wear any of her jackets, saying they were "old."  Another family member brought her a jacket and lifted her spirits.  We haven't had any problems since.  She seems to have lost some of her strength.  She fell once without hurting herself.  I'm guessing my trip disrupted her exercise routine.

I was glad to see her remember to bring a bag with a diaper in it when we went out.  This is a bag I bought her from India many years ago.  I'm trying to support her as she takes care of herself, putting on and taking off her sweaters, jackets and shoes, bringing tissue and a diaper, etc.  She sometimes asks for her purse.  I only give it to her when she needs it because I'm also trying to minimize the number of things I have to keep track of.  Every outing comes with considerable uncertainty and I'd like to focus on her personal safety.

Yesterday was 冬節 Dongzhi or dung¹ zit³/冬至 dung¹ zi³/做冬 zou⁶ dung¹.  I had only known the occasion to be a family feast, which we didn’t celebrate in my household when I was growing up in Hong Kong.  I only just found out it marks the winter solstice.  I scheduled a meal with my aunt and my mom, not knowing it was 冬節.  Navigating the busy city streets pushing my mom in a wheelchair, tranferring from one elevator to another in the mall wasn't easy.  All in all, it was heart warming to see my aunt from my dad’s side get together with my mom for a family meal on this day, with my parents divorced for decades.  We had a pleasant dim sum meal.

The Shau Kei Wan waterfront promenade has been a spot for my walks on days when I don’t visit my mom.  The raptors and shorebirds are a reminder we have the company of other animals in this urban milieu.  I was surprised to see them in such a busy district.  I watched an egret perched on a boat stay on even as the boat started to move.

My guess is the white birds are egrets.  They are serene creatures.  I often wonder if I've seen the same egrets on both sides of the Pacific, like container ships.  I feel a special affinity for migratory creatures like whales and certain shorebirds, being a migratory animal myself.

I saw raptors glide effortlessly in circles, riding invisible currents.  There was a flock of them flying high in the sky, which I found unusual.  I am more used to seeing solitary raptors.

The flock dispersed after a while.  A lone raptor descended, circling closer to the boats.
