I was at Repulse Bay for a birthday party: good conversation in Cantonese, Mandarin and English, canned cocktails and salted egg potato chips, which were addictive as advertised.  A translator at the party told me the etymology of the word "Mandarin": 滿大人 mǎn dà rén, Manchurian official.  Mystery solved.  We talked about inaccurate transliterations, like "Amoy," a garbled attempt to import 廈門 xià mén from Mandarin or haa⁶ mun⁴ from Cantonese.

It started to rain late afternoon.  I was sorry to leave, though I knew I would see the birthday boy and some of the guests again at the weekly poetry open mic in Central.  As we were saying goodbye, I saw a slim Asian woman in the water.  In the Bay Area, I tell people I don't swim in cold water because I don't have much upper body fat.  This woman was there just to prove me wrong.  I have no excuse.

Eileen Chang's Chinese name 張愛玲 is on every book.  As a writer, I would have wanted to see many different titles.  This sculpture might be more about the idea of books, popular books.  On the beach, a woman from Inner Mongolia who had a masters degree in literature told me she had been reading Siddartha in Chinese.  Now that's a book I would've liked to see in this stack:
