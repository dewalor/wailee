Mom's been walking at her daycare and in physical therapy.  When I first suggested we go out yesterday, she wanted to walk.  I got her a walker, a loaner from the nursing home, and she walked from her room to the dining hall, saying she wanted to have breakfast.  I asked her if she could tell what time it was.  After some effort, she said: three o'clock.  It was clear to me she had walked enough and needed to rest, so I took her out in a wheelchair.

We spent hours at the park.  She practiced walking, first at a play structure, then at a pavillion up the hill.  Apart from the usual spider flowers, we saw quite a few pigeons getting ready to settle down for the day.  At the pavillion, she decided to go down a set of stairs, which made me uneasy.  The stairs weren't connected to any wheelchair accessible paths, which meant she had to go down yet another set of stairs to reach the bottom.  Luckily, she was able to do so after resting for a bit in between.  She waited patiently while I lugged her wheelchair down the stairs.

It seems more and more likely she'll be able to walk on her own in the coming months.  She's been asking questions at daycare about why she needs to stay within certain boundaries.  The daycare manager suggested I invite her for an overnight stay at my house on Christmas Day.  Since I don't know where I'll be in December, I can't make plans just yet.  I did learn some things at an information session hosted by the daycare about accommodations she might need if she were to stay in an apartment.

After a few months of living in a tiny room in Tsim Sha Tsui, I moved into a friend's apartment in Tseun Wan.  He's away for the summer.  I feel at home here, among books and art prints.  I'm going to be here for at least two months -- no plans beyond August though.

Tseun Wan has hidden beaches with waterfront views, for those who have access to a car and are able to walk down a long staircase.  I suppose there are many small beaches like these in Hong Kong, offering a slice of quiet.
