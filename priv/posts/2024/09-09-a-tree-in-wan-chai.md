I've been eating out with my mom once or a twice a week--not as often as I'd like.  It takes me an hour and fifteen minutes to get to her nursing home from Tsuen Wan.  I'm planning to move back to Hong Kong Island to be closer to her.  I've been working US East Coast hours, 9 pm to 5 am Hong Kong time, staying up after work to take her out for breakfast.

This tree stands out amidst the bustle of Wan Chai.  It's about four stories tall, quite unusual for this corner of city.  I seem to recall seeing the same tree taking the tram home to Happy Valley as a teenager.  My mom lived around the corner from here when she was a girl.

Mom has been walking pretty well.  The physical therapy she's been getting at the nursing home seems effective.  I walked around with her on her floor in the nursing home before we went out for dim sum a couple of days ago.  Outdoors, she's been able to walk two long block/four short blocks consistently.  Sometimes, she sits down to rest at a bus stop.  I hope to walk with her to restaurants further away in the next few weeks.  There is no shortage of restaurants in the area.

Now that I'm not seeing my mom as often, I'm more worried about her mental health.  I saw her laughing as we were eating, so I asked her why.  She told me there was a couple recounting the early days of their relationship.  To keep the crows from listening to the dialogue, there had to be a tent over the couple.  I asked her if this was happening on TV or in person, at the restaurant.  She said: Both.  I'm hoping to bring her back to present by spending more time with her.
