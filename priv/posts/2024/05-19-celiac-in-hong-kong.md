I thought I'd take my mom out to pizza yesterday, to shake off the virus variant blues.  She does like variation in her diet.  It had been a while since I'd last had pizza--it's not easy to find celiac-friendly food in a new place.  There were copious glowing reviews of Pizza Express by celiacs online.  When I arrived at the Times Square branch, I found no gluten-free options on the menu.  The manager told me their supplier had stopped offering it during the pandemic.  I ordered penne ai funghi for my mom and the octopus carpaccio appetizer for myself.  She liked her dish.  I accomplished one of my goals.

She readily agreed to dim sum and a walk in Victoria Park today.  The parallel bars were perfect for her to practice walking again.  She went back and forth several times before returning to her wheelchair.  There was a group singing nearby, which made our bench next to the hisbiscus flowers a pleasant place to rest for a while.  Mom felt the first drops of rain and immediately said she wanted to go back.  I was slow to respond, so we got a bit wet.  As we left the park, I heard a woman singing over what sounded like a gamelan melody coming from a boom box.
