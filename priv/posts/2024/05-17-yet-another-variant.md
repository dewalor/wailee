My friend who is a medical doctor and has a PhD in Public Health had warned me there would be many coronavirus variants.  My mom's nursing home sent out a notice just before Mother's Day that she had to be in isolation for a few days--there had been new cases on her floor.  I had already gone out to dim sum with her and taken her to Victoria Park.  I did say I was going to see her the next day.  I wasn't worried about catching the virus--I'd caught COVID only a month ago.  I decided to stop by briefly on Sunday, for fifteen minutes, to drop off a bouquet and some food.  She was glad to see me.  One of the other residents at the nursing home saw me and asked why I was there.  Busted.  I tried to make myself look smaller, and said: I'm only here briefly....

The next few days I stuck to the rules.  I ordered delivery for her on Monday and gave her a call.  She sounded ok.  Tuesday, I ordered delivery for her but couldn't get anyone at the nursing home to pick up the phone.  I called ten times.  Wednesday I sent a WhatsApp message to see if her floor had reopened.  There was no response, so I showed up late afternoon with some takeout.  My mom was lying in bed, listless.  As I approached, I could tell she needed a diaper change.  I got a staff member to help her and took her out to dinner and to the park.  I had the feeling if I hadn't stopped by, she might've stayed in bed for a long time.  On Thursday, I took her out in the morning and brought her back too late.  She missed the van that drove her to day care, so I took public transportation with her instead.  She didn't seem happy to be in day care.  Today, I arrived early afternoon to take her to her dietitian's appointment.  She would not budge.  I had to cancel the appointment.  She didn't even want to go out to eat.  I wondered if I was seeing the cumulative effects of isolation.  After a great deal of back and forth, I got her some beef noodles, which she devoured.  She promised we would go out for pizza tomorrow.  We shall see....
